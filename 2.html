                        <p class="mb-30">In this project, I performed an exploratory analysis of private aircraft flight data to uncover patterns in fuel consumption, flight frequency, and travel times. Using Power BI, I visualized key metrics like fuel burn by aircraft type, airport visit trends, and enroute times by city of origin. 
                            The dashboards included bar charts, scatter plots, and time-series analyses, helping reveal operational inefficiencies and usage patterns across multiple locations. This project highlights my ability to transform raw transportation data into actionable insights using modern business intelligence tools.</p>
