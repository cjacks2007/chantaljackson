                        <p class="mb-30">Following the merger of two regional restaurant chains, I conducted a full descriptive analysis to profile the new joint customer base, track spending trends, and identify the most and least profitable products. Using Power BI, I integrated and cleaned data from both companies, visualized revenue patterns across months, regions, demographics, and customer types, and provided strategic insights to inform a three-year profitability plan. 
                            This project sharpened my expertise in business data integration, customer segmentation, and executive-level reporting.</p>
